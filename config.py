# Stores different training configurations -
# A config file with three presets: 'test' (quick testing), 'default' (normal training), 
# and 'heavy' (serious long training). 
# Contains all hyperparameters like learning rate, epsilon decay, replay buffer size, etc.
# Makes it easy to switch between different training setups without editing code.
